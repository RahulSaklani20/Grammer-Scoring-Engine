# Grammer-Scoring-Engine
 a machine learning-based Grammar Scoring Engine that predicts grammar scores from spoken audio. The project uses librosa for extracting audio features such as MFCC, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid, and applies an XGBoost model to predict grammar scores ranging from 1.0 to 5.0.
